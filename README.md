Commit 1: Made all my scenes in game.js and edited the duration on messages in adventure.js
Created my first game scene and made the intro work.
Gonna keep working on the next scenes 1 at a time and hope for no issues.
Maybe I can change the background color or inventory font to feel more 'gamey'.
Also wanna add 'buy' and 'broke' methods to adventurejs
the buy one 

Commit 2: I added the buy method and worked on adding a couple things for the next scene.
Added bank account system.
gonna stop 4 now

Commit 3: I finished all the rooms
Fixed buy method
Added all the pngs to different signs
everything is working

Scenes "Navi" "Front Entrance" "Furniture Store" "Clothes Store" and "Food Court" are the AdventureScene Scenes

Intro and Outro are not using adventure scene

I added the buy method and the bankaccount to the adventure engine.

Front Entrance, Furniture Store, Clothes Store, Food Court, and Navi are 5 locations

These scenes almost all have 2+ interactive objects

Every object has pointerover message.
Every object has pointerdown effect.

Money in "Front Entrance" is animated.
