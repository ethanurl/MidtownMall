Commit 1: Made all my scenes in game.js and edited the duration on messages in adventure.js
Created my first game scene and made the intro work.
Gonna keep working on the next scenes 1 at a time and hope for no issues.
Maybe I can change the background color or inventory font to feel more 'gamey'.
